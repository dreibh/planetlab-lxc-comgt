Building gcom
=============
Switch to the directory where files from gcom.tgz were unpacked. Run:

	make all

You can run gcom immediately if your datacard is plugged in and the 
USB devices used by it have the appropriate permissions.

To install gcom, sigmon and their documentation, become root,
make sure you're in the directory where gcom was compiled and run:

	make install

This will install gcom and sigmon in /usr/local/bin and their manpages 
in /usr/local/man/man1. If this doesn't match your installation or you 
want to install the executables and manpages somewhere else, simply 
edit the EXE and MAN macro definitions on lines 3 and 4 of Makefile.

To remove the executables and manpages, become root, make sure you're 
in the directory where gcom was compiled and run:

	make uninstall

To tidy to after installing gcom, make sure you're logged in as the
used who compiled gcom and in the directory where gcom was compiled.
Then run:

	make clean

The example scripts included in the distribution are left in the
build directory.
